# Django_blog_post_app
This app works on a current localhost server and is not deployed yet, 
I found it easier developing it on a virtual environment since it helps in easier management of Django files.
The pages use templates that are enabled in Django.
It has been an amazing experience and am willing to indulge more on this.
