# Django_blog_post_app
This app works on a current localhost server and is not deployed yet, 
I found it easier developing it on a virtual environment since it helps in easier management of Django files.
The pages use templates that are enabled in Django.
It has been an amazing experience and am willing to indulge more on this.

The app works like a blogging system like twitter and allows users to sign up, login, post their content, see other peoples content, edit and delete their own content and finally, change their usernames, profile pics and password.
The project is not complete yet but for now it does all the functionalities its supposed to do.
It is not complete on the basis of deployment and setting a convincing storage platform, but that is what I will work on later on.
